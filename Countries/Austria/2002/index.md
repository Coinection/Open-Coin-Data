## Description

The Austrian euro coins each feature unique designs representing Austria's cultural heritage and natural beauty: the €1 and €2 coins depict famous historical Austrians (Bertha von Suttner and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart), the 10, 20 and 50 cent coins show famous Austrian buildings (Vienna Secession building, Belvedere Palace and St Stephen's Cathedral), and the 1, 2 and 5 cent coins feature Alpine flowers (gentian, edelweiss, and alpine primrose). The Austrian coins also state the value on the national side.
