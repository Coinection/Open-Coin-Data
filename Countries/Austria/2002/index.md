## Description

The Austrian euro coins have a unique design for each coin representing Austria's cultural heritage and natural beauty: the €1 and €2 coins feature famous historical Austrians (Bertha von Suttner and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart), 10, 20 and 50 cent coins show famous Austrian buildings (Vienna Secession building, Belvedere Palace and St Stephen's Cathedral), and the 1, 2 and 5 cent coins depict Alpine flowers (gentian, edelweiss, and alpine primrose). The Austrian coins also state the value on the national side.
